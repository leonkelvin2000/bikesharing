# bikesharing


## Analysis Overview
- The purpose of the analysis was to look at bikesharing data from New York to draw conclusions about the program to help with the pitch to investors who are looking to invest in a bikesharing project in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Resources
- Software: Tableau Public
- Software: Visual Studio Code
- Language: Python
- Library: Pandas

# Summary
## Overview
Here are some of the high-level conclusions that we have gotten about bikesharing programs through our analysis. Many of the conclusions that we have drawn can be applied to looking at the opportunity in Des Moines, with adjustments for local differences.

- There are times of the day, and days of the week where bikes are much more in demand than others. For example Thursday from 5-7pm has the highest demand, with other times and days with very good demand at times that make sense (ex. 7-10am and 5-7pm weekdays when people are commuting from or to their homes). Understanding the demand at various times will give an idea of required investment in bicycles to satisfy rider demand at peak periods and allow for better maintenance planning.

- Subscribers tend to drive much more of the demand than casual drivers, so a key part of the success of such of program will required a focus on having a good subscriber program with marketing campaign to attract them into the program quickly. There is however a difference on types of riders with women, they tend to be more casual customers and so it would be important to also factor that into marketing program to ensure to capture as many customers as possible.

- The ride times tend to be quite short with a large % of people riding for less than 20 minutes. There are however some people riding much longer (60min and more), but the number of rides drop very quickly by 45 minutes. Interesting enough that as we approach 60 minutes, the split between genders converges and continues at similar level beyond 60 minutes. Understanding the key usage of riders may have an impact of the type/style of bicycle that should be purchased for the program.

- Looking at the most popular start and stop bike stations, we see that most are gathered in busy downtown core, where there is both business as well as tourist sites and other attractions, so that should be considered as the choice for where to have stations setup.

## Recommended Additional Visualizations
- Something else that would be interesting to see along with all the other information we have looked at is the distance that each bike travels (using the start and end stations as a proxy) to get an idea of what % of bikes are used the most and what does that distance look like (measure of usage). This information could help us understand a little more around what type of maintenance program may be required.
- We looked a lot at all the usage, but another visualization we should look at are the number of bikes that are not being used on different days and times. This would give us a better understanding of how much of the fleet of bikes are underutilized throughout the week. The investment in bikes for such a program is very high, and we would want to make sure to have the right level of bike inventory to service the peak periods, but also good to see how many bikes are spending time idle.
